// ðŸ”¹ 1. Encapsulation

// balance in BankAccount is marked as private, so it cannot be directly accessed from outside the class.

// Instead, you use methods (deposit, withdraw, getBalance) to interact with it.

//  This hides the internal details and ensures controlled access.

// ðŸ”¹ 2. Abstraction

// The user of BankAccount doesnâ€™t need to know how balance is stored or updated.

// They just call deposit(50) or withdraw(30) without worrying about implementation details.

//  This is abstraction: showing only essential operations and hiding internal complexity.


// ðŸ”¹ 3. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) (from SOLID principles)

// BankAccount only manages money.

// AccountPrinter only handles printing.

//  Each class has one reason to change, making the code clean and modular.


// ðŸ”¹ 4. Composition

// AccountPrinter depends on BankAccount (it uses it in print(account: BankAccount)).

// This is a form of has-a relationship (composition).

//  The printer doesnâ€™t exist without an account to print.
